# TorchSharp
*torchsharp* is a framework for PyTorch which provides a set of sharp utilities aiming at speeding up programming and encouraging code re-use.

This repository consists of:

- [torchsharp.data](#data) : Useful stuff about data operation such as dummy datasets and  image tranforms for data argumentation, etc.
- [torchsharp.model](#data) : Helpful fucntions about model training process such as initializer and metrics, etc.
- [torchsharp.utils](#data) : Other tools like logger and timer, etc.
